Steps to solve system design interview questions

- Step 1: Clarify the function requirements
    - Functional requirement, What specific features are we going to build?
    - Non-Functional requirement, 
        - How many users does the product have?
        - What are performance requirement for the system? Ex, Latency requirement, robustness, scalability, resilience, extendability
    - What is the companyâ€™s technology stack? What dependencies we could use?
- Step 2: Ask about the capacity estimation and constraints
    - Make assumptions. (MAU, DAU, usage rate) 
    - Estimate traffic volume (Read and Write TPS)
    - Estimate data size
    - Estimate bandwidth 
- Step 3: Design System APIs. 
    - What are the Parameters for the APIs
    - What are the APIs we want to support (CURD)
- Step 4: Database Design
    - Database schema
    - Size of a single record
    - What is the primary key, what are the attributes?
    - DataType of each attributes
    - What are the indexes?
    - SQL or non-SQL
- Step 5: Basic System Design and Algorithm
    - List out the pros and cons for different design options
    - Draw Component diagram. 
- Step 6: Data Partitioning and Replication
    - How can we partition the database if we have a large amount of data? 
        - Hash-Based partitioning
- Step 7: Cache
    - Which cache eviction policy should we use? Least Recently Used (LRU)
    - How much memory will we use?
    - How to update the replica of cache?
- Step 8: Load Balancer
    - Most simple version is the round robin approach. 
    - But we can also route traffic according to the avg latency for a single host. Less latency host can get more traffic. 
- Step 9: Purging or cleanup unused data. 
    - Clean data on the fly as part of a request
    - Schedule service to clean up data once in a while
- Step 10: Security and permissions request
    - Who can have permission to access certain resources. 
- Step 11: Monitoring, alarms, metrics, dashboards, and operations
